# Exploring react

I've been a long time vue user, but my current company uses react for the front end. I've kind of been avoiding learning
react up util this point, but considering I'm going to rewrite a front end client for a personal project I figured I
should bite the bullet and start learning react.

I'm following
the [legacy react tutorial](https://legacy.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#inspecting-the-starter-code). Oof I didn't
realize I was following a legacy tutorial until writing this line. Looks
like [the current version of the tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) has some updated concepts,
soooooooooooo I guess I'm branching and redoing the tutorial :facepalm:.
